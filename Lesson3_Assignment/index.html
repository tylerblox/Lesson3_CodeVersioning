            <p class="lead">Repository's are like storage containers in a room of an office building.  They store all of the files so that they can be found later on by someone looking for them.  They keep the files in order of how they were put in there; in other words, files are put in in their branch heirarchy.  Files are put in a repository through a program called Git.  Of course, this is only one of many possible programs to use, in git you write a command in the terminal to put the updated files in a repository.  the files must first be put in the staging area before they can be stored in the repo.  To do this you use the command $ add ... then to keep a copy of how the files currently look in the repo you use the code $ commit followed by -m '(insert message here)'.  Finally to upload them to a remote repository you then use $ push.  More on remote repo's later.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> When editing files with a team it is laborious to keep a file in only one local computers local memory.  In order to edit a file then, the whole file must be packaged and sent to another team member.  Instead a Remote repository can be used to keep the file in a place that can be accessed by any team members by pulling the file onto their local computer.  Repositories also help to make versions of a program because the program is saved at many times and a screenshot is taken of the code that can be reverted back to at any time.  In that sense remote repositories are also safety checks to ensure that no pertinent information gets erased.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The company that I worked for this Summer shared an office space with a technology company in the same sector.  I became friends with the CTO of the company and asked him a lot of questions about how they organized their code to be used across different platforms.  He kept referring to this mysterious application called Git Hub.  I did a lot of research into the benefits of this application.  I saw that the members of the team in the office would with ease be able to pull each others work and make edits of their own.  They could very easily see the changes in the code as they were updadted.  On top of that the CFO told me that any Program I could ever imagine running has a version already on Git Hub and with some alterations they could be made to fit my needs and in their case, their needs.  To use an analogy, Git Hub is the lane that the bowling ball traveled to get to the pins.  It was a smooth path that allowed easy connection between workers and also gave a great place for the creators to source their code.  </p>
